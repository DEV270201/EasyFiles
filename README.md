# EasyFiles
Built a centralized file management application through which you can upload pdf/docx files to the server, download them whenever needed and save on your device as well as delete them from the server.

If you want to run the code on your device, just clone the repository and run npm install in both client and server folder if you are using npm else similar command for yarn.
Kindly create config.env file in the server folder and paste the content:

ENV=development 

PORT=4000 

DATABASE=your mongodb url 

JWT_SECRET=paste your secret 

DEFAULT= default url for profile for cloudinary 

CLOUD_NAME=cloud name 

API_SECRET=your cloudinary secret 

API_KEY=your cludinary key 

once you install all the packages, run npm start in both client and server folder and you are good to go :) 

Further development: 
1) File preview without downloading file 
2) Indicator of how muc the file has been downloaded
